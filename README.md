# Python-Average-Function

Implement a function that:

Is named avg

Takes a variable number of integer arguments; it is guaranteed that at least one argument will be passed

Returns the average value of the passed arguments as a float

 

The implementation will be tested by a provided code stub on several input files. Each input file contains one line with space-separated arguments for the function. The function will be called with those arguments, and the returned result will be printed to the output with exactly 2 decimal places.

 

Example

3 arguments are read and passed to the function: 1, 2, and 3. The average is calculated to be (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.00. This is then returned as a float to be printed.

 

Constraints

1 ≤ number of arguments for the function ≤ 100

-100 ≤ value of passed arguments ≤ 100

 

Input Format Format for Custom Testing
Sample Case 0
Sample Input

STDIN     Function
-----     -----
2 5    →  arguments = [2, 5]
 

Sample Output

3.50
 

Explanation

The function will be called with 2 arguments having values 2 and 5. The average of those numbers is 3.5. This value is returned and will be printed to the output with 2 decimal places.

Sample Case 1
Sample Input

STDIN     Function
-----     -----
7      →  arguments = 7
 

Sample Output

7.00
 

Explanation

The function will be called with 1 argument with the value 7. The average of one number is the number itself, so 7.0 is returned in this case. That value will be printed to the output with 2 decimal places.


    x = list(map(float,input().split()))
    def avg(x):
        y = "{:.2f}".format(sum(x)/len(x))
        return y
    print(avg(x))
